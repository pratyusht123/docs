## Quick anatomy

| Area | What the admin sees | What it’s for |
|------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Global header** | *Help • Save Draft • Publish Request* | Save work or ship live links. |
| **Left-hand nav** | *Proof Request → Landing Page → Flow Setup → …* | Jump between the seven steps. |
| **Main canvas** | Context-sensitive forms | Where you make choices. |
| **“?” Help button** | Purple spark, bottom-right | Instant tips & chat support. |

---

## Step 1 — Proof Request

### Why it matters  
This is the **contract** you’re asking the user to fulfil: *what* to show, *who* must show it, and any example they can copy.

### Fields & real-world effects

| Field | What the admin decides | What the user sees / must do |
|-------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Category** | Pick the closest label (Custom, Education, etc.). | A matching icon appears on the finished proof card; later, filters in dashboards. |
| **Title** | Short sentence like “2024 Income Proof”. | Shown in the secure-browser header and in emails. |
| **Description** | Friendly instructions in your own words. | Appears right before screenshot capture and in reminder emails. |
| **Generate with AI** | Let InkLink draft Title + Description. | User sees the generated text exactly as saved. |
| **Example URL (optional)** | Paste a sample proof link or webpage. | A “See example” link appears so users know what “good” looks like. |
| **User Validation** | Decide if the screenshot must belong to the same person creating it. | • **Off** – anyone can create the proof.<br>• **Strict** – name on screenshot must match their verified ID; mismatch = error.<br>• **Fuzzy** – minor spelling tweaks accepted, fewer failures.<br>• **Third-Party** – parents/agents can create on someone else’s behalf; the finished proof reads “Submitted by X for Y”. |
| **Note to Self** | Private memo for teammates. | User never sees it—only fellow admins reviewing the request. |

---

## Step 2 — Landing Page

| Option | Admin picks | End-user experience |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Requester Name** | Choose legal name, brand name, or campaign alias. | Name shows in big text at top of the landing page and in browser tab title. |
| **Button Text** | Swap “Create Proof” for any 25-char phrase. | Whatever you type becomes the big call-to-action button. |
| **Notes** | Extra context: deadlines, support email, incentives. | Text appears under the button. If blank, the note section is hidden to keep things tidy. |

> **Tip:** Short, upbeat notes (“Takes 2-3 min on mobile.”) boost starts by ~10 %.

---

## Step 3 — Flow Setup

### 3.1  Animation before the browser opens

| Choice | What happens to the user |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **None** | Secure browser pops up instantly—fastest load. |
| **Short (2 s)** | Quick loader that just says “Opening secure browser…”. |
| **Long (5 s, default)** | Adds a branded reassurance slide (“We never store your passwords”). Best for first-timers. |

### 3.2  Screen-Capture Modes

| Mode | Good for… | User journey |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Single** *(default)* | One-page proofs like pay-slips or ID cards. | User lands on target page, clicks **Capture** once, then moves straight to review. |
| **Multiple – user decides** | Situations where needed info varies (e.g., freelance portfolios). | A floating **Capture** button follows them; they can snap 1, 2, or 10 screenshots, then hit **Finish**. |
| **Multiple Defined** | Highly structured flows (e.g., three specific tax pages). | User sees a wizard: **Step 1 of 3**, takes the required shot, clicks **Next**, etc., until all mandatory screens are complete. |

> **Best practice:** Start with **Single**—it’s quickest and has the highest completion rate.

### 3.3  Post-capture options

| Toggle | If ON… | User impact |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Confirmation Modal** | Show “Here’s what we captured—proceed?” | Users can retake if they missed something, cutting support tickets. |
| **Allow Redaction** | Blur tool enabled. | Users draw boxes over personal info before submitting. |
| **Include Screenshot** | Thumbnail appears on proof card. | Reviewers can eyeball proof quality without downloading the full image. |
| **Add to Blockchain** | Proof hash anchored on-chain. | A “Verified on blockchain” badge shows on the proof card. |
| **Allow Removal of Auto-extracted Data** | Users may delete optional fields pulled by AI. | Useful for privacy when extraction grabs extra numbers (e.g., full account IDs). |

---

## Step 4 — Recommendations

| Admin action | User sees |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Show Panel** toggled ON | A tip box appears *before* the secure browser launches. |
| **Write tips** in the editor | Your Markdown renders exactly—great for “Make sure you’re on desktop” or step-by-step GIFs. |
| **Generate Tips with AI** | InkLink suggests bullet points based on the target site (edit as needed). |

---

## Step 5 — Badge Image

| Choice | Result for the user |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Upload PNG/SVG** | Proof card shows your custom icon—nice for brand recognition. |
| **Restore Default** | Reverts to the generic category icon. |

---

## Step 6 — User Email (only if you send requests via InkLink mailer)

| Editable part | What the recipient gets |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Subject line** | Appears in their inbox—keep ≤ 60 chars to avoid truncation. |
| **HTML body** | The email they click; supports inline images and buttons. |
| **Footer** | Uses your workspace default unless you override for this request. |

> **Reminder cadence:** InkLink auto-nudges at 24 h and 72 h unless the user starts the proof. You can disable nudges in **Workspace › Email Settings**.

---

## Step 7 — Other Settings

| Admin sets | End-user / analytics effect |
|------------|----------------------------|
| **Custom Source ID** (e.g., `summer-promo-25`) | Tag shows up in dashboards and in webhook payloads so you can tell which campaign drove each proof. Invisible to the user. |

---

## Publish & iterating later

| Action | What happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Publish Request** | Generates a shareable link + API slug. Anyone with the link can start the flow immediately. |
| **Need to edit?** | Click **Edit**, make changes, then **Publish** again. Old links keep the old version; new link uses the update. |

## Appendix A — Credibility colours (what approvers will see)

* **Green (≥ 70)** — ready to trust auto-pass  
* **Amber (40-69)** — looks fine but may need spot-check  
* **Red (< 40)** — routed to manual review queue  

Most everyday proofs land in the high-60s to low-80s once blockchain anchoring is on.
